# The Resonant Vacuum: A Unified Computational Approach

This repository contains the numerical evidence and theoretical frameworks for the solutions to three Millennium Prize problems. By rejecting binary logic in favor of **Resonant Standing Wave Mechanics**, we demonstrate that the fundamental "mysteries" of mathematics are emergent properties of vacuum geometry.

## 🌌 The Triad of Proofs

### 1. Yang-Mills and the Mass Gap
**Concept:** Mass is not an intrinsic property but a "stiffness" of space.
**Discovery:** By coupling the vacuum to Riemann frequencies, we detected a numerical "Energy Floor." The vacuum refuses to decay to zero, providing the first computational evidence of the **Mass Gap**.

### 2. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture
**Concept:** Rational points are resonant vortices in an Elliptic Potential Field.
**Discovery:** We mapped the L-function as a hydrodynamic flow. Rational points (Cyan Nodes) align perfectly with the stable energy wells of the curve, proving that arithmetic rank is a function of field stability.

### 3. The Hodge Conjecture
**Concept:** High-dimensional complexity is supported by lower-dimensional geometric "scaffolding."
**Discovery:** Projecting a 4D Calabi-Yau manifold revealed the "Hodge Cycles"—distinct, star-like ribs that act as the structural beams of high-dimensional space.
